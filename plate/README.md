## TS69 Plate

Please scale it up by 0.26% (x1.0026) when printing, because this board is designed with 19mm key pitch, when it should have been 19.05mm pitch (=3/4 in). (19.05/19 = 1.00263...)  
Without scaling, it will only have 304mm of total width where we need 304.8mm. 0.8mm difference makes the key on the both sides very difficult to fit.
