** TS68 Plate

Due to usability of the Tinkercad, this board is designed with 19mm key pitch, when it should have been 19.05mm pitch (=3/4 in). Please scale it up by 0.26% (x1.0026) when printing. 

Without scaling it will only have 304mm of total width where we need 304.8mm. 0.8mm difference makes the key on the both sides won't fit at all.
