## TS68 Plate

Please scale it up by 0.26% (x1.0026) when printing, because this board is designed with 19mm key pitch, when it should have been 19.05mm pitch (=3/4 in). (this is due to usability of Tinkercad)

Without scaling it will only have 304mm of total width where we need 304.8mm. 0.8mm difference makes the key on the both sides won't fit at all.

## Layout

Only the backspace key section is customizable. The backspace key can be split in two to be able to arrange like H*KB.
